# Authentic Alignment Wellness Theme

## Sass
sass scss/flaxen.scss css/app.css --watch

## Built on Wordpress and Foundation

### CSS Grid Design

- functions file could use some real cleaning up but this was having issues when I tried to do it really quickly
- pagination on page-view-results.php works but Im sure it could be cleaner if I just use a wordpress version
- I would guess some of the grids could become flex to make it a little less complex
- scss needs cleaning up and better documentation
- The SVGs for the social menu are pretty scrappy and only work in certain conditions but as I'm working out how the best way to do them for now its fine
